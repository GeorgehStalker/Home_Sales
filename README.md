# Home_Sales
Home Sales Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing home sales data using Apache Spark and PySpark to gain insights into the housing market. The dataset includes various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and price of homes sold. The primary goal is to uncover trends and averages related to home prices based on different criteria, including the number of bedrooms, year built, and view ratings.

The project begins by setting up the necessary environment, installing dependencies, and loading the data from an AWS S3 bucket into a Spark DataFrame. Subsequent analyses involve calculating average home prices for specific categories, such as four-bedroom houses, and filtering based on various attributes. Additionally, the project demonstrates the use of temporary tables and caching to optimize queries, as well as data partitioning for efficient storage in Parquet format.

Results from this analysis can help stakeholders understand pricing trends and make informed decisions in the real estate market. The code is organized to facilitate easy navigation and understanding, making it a useful resource for anyone interested in data science applications within the housing sector.

Feel free to explore the repository, review the code, and leverage the insights generated from this analysis!
